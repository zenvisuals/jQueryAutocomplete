# jQueryAutocomplete
Using the jQuery UI, this autocomplete widget has been modified to fetch data from multiple remote sources.

The data is fetched using jQuery's getJSON function and returned as an array of items.

The source of the widget then takes in the array of items and displayed accordingly.

The array of items can also be categorised by mapping each set of data from a remote source.
